Let's propose a goal. The goal is that every last person on earth be free to
succeed, to realize their potential.  This implies that they already enjoy
basic human rights to nutritious food, drinkable water, adequate shelter,
treatment of illness and protection from disease, freedom, and education.

This is not a new idea.  The men who wrote the United States Constitution
stated in its preamble, its purpose, "to form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote
the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
Posterity". Of course they were all white, all male, and largely slave owners.
When they wrote "ourselves" they may have meant it. Let's suppose, however,
that they were referring to the new nation.

A similar group eleven years earlier wrote the Declaration of
Independence for the British colonies of the American continent, at the
continental congress of 1776, which stated the rights of people "to assume
among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws
of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them" and to "Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness".  The anniversary of that document, July 4th, is
traditionally celebrated in the United States with family time, possibly some
shopping of sales, and evening
fireworks.

In the constitution of Uruguay, article seven states, "Los habitantes de la
República tienen derecho a ser protegidos en el goce de su vida, honor,
libertad, seguridad, trabajo y propiedad. Nadie puede ser privado de estos
derechos sino conforme a las leyes que se establecen por razones de interés
general." A translation, "The inhabitants of the republic have the right to be
protected in the enjoyment of their life, honor, liberty, security, work, and
property. No person may be denied these rights outside of the law established
for the general welfare."

## Liberty

Notwithstanding constitutions, we have a human rights goal.
The goal is that every last person on earth be free to
succeed, to realize their potential. Breaking this down we have:

- Universal: all people, every single one
- Freedom: to follow the path, to make choices, to be valued
- Success: which is not necessarily monetary but rather realization
- Realization: to achieve, to be and to become
- Potential: that exists in all, to some degree, that it be realized

Let's call the goal, "liberty". Liberty
for all people, everywhere on earth and even beyond earth. (The
astronauts serving on the international space station are voluntarily captive
for a fixed term.)

Let's try an assertion about liberty and it's converse:
- That everyone has liberty implies that each individual has liberty.
- That each individual has liberty implies that everyone has liberty.

So far, so good.

Let's try the contrapositives of those:
- That some individuals are not free implies that not everyone is free.
- That not everyone is free implies that some individuals are not free.

This looks okay, too.

So we know that if everyone is individually free, the goal is accomplished.
Now let's reword those slightly. Instead of "implies" we'll say, "depends
upon":
- The liberty of everyone depends upon the liberty of every individual.
  That is certainly true.  If there is one individual who is not free, then
  everyone is not free.
- The liberty of each individual depends upon the liberty of everyone.  Here
  we're no longer on solid ground. That everyone is not free does not imply
  that no-one is free. Nor does the fact that there are free individuals imply
  that everyone is free.

Individual liberty is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for universal
liberty. It's easy to see how we might fall into doing what is necessary--
achieving individual liberty --while failing to do what is sufficient--
achieving universal liberty.

## For all

Do we go about achieving the goal by enabling individuals to be free, or do we
go about it by enabling the liberty of all?

Given that even one individual
failure signifies failure of the goal you might say that fighting for
individual liberty is essential.  However gaining widespread, universal liberty
one person at a time is a long road and losing proposition. The goal has to be
liberty for all.  Achieving that, we've taken care of the individuals.

In the United States we place great emphasis on individual liberty.  (This
in spite of the pledge of allegiance in which we say, "One nation ... with
liberty and justice for all".) That some individuals are free, or successful,
we think, points to the fact that all individuals can be free and successful.
Failure of universal liberty is a failure of the individual. They didn't take
the chances they had. They didn't study in school. They made bad choices.

We work to fix the bad individuals, or class them into groups and work to fix
the bad groups. In either case, the culpability lies with the individual.
Individuals can be free. If they're not, it's their own fault. We're not
talking only about criminals and sociopaths. The logic applies to the poor,
the unemployed, the homeless, and the hungry.

In other places, individual liberty is understood to be closely related to the
collective good. By working to create liberty for all, we create free
individuals. Doing this requires painting liberty with a broad brush.
It requires, just to pick one example, basic health care freely available,
just as education is, to all. Speaking of education, premium investment in
the same. We could pay some teachers better and hire more of them.
It requires that every child to the age of three is well nourished and
protected. That implies everyone else in the household as well--
mother, father, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts an uncles.

That might be hard to accept for some; however, it's the reality of liberty and
justice for all. If we really mean, "for all".

So there, now that you're frightened, there's the commitment that liberty
requires. It's a courageous step.

Nutritious food, clean and drinkable water, adequate shelter, treatment of
illness and protection from disease, freedom, and education are not achieved by
working for individual liberties. They are achieved by working to create
liberty for all, and by extension, every individual.
