What follows is an editorial about us.
Written by Jan Erskine, it
made rounds among a circle of friends and family, and found its way to me.
I'm reproducing it here with permission.

From Jan:

It’s not enough to blame President Trump or even President Trump and the GOP.
We have all been complicit in undermining our Democracy.

- When we bitterly complain about our ineffectual elected leaders and then
  re-elect them, we add to the anger and disdain that fueled President Trump’s
  election.
- When we ignore the growing influence of the lobbyists and the entanglements
  of businesses with politicians, we give away our rights as individuals to
  expect those we elect to represent our interests. 
- When we watch “reality tv”, we blur the lines between the real and the untrue
  and give rise to the news media that no longer are unbiased, or grounded in
  ferreting out the truth. 
- When we let our state politicians redistrict to ensure that the party
  favorites win, we dismantle our Democracy’s foundation of one person one
  vote.
- When we rail against taxes without understanding how we fund essential
  services we undercut our nations ability to function.
- When we turn our heads while the super rich take more and more control over
  the election process, we disenfranchise citizens struggling to get by. 
- When we disparage unions and think that we don’t need the force and
  protection that comes from being united, we erode hard won benefits and add
  to the disparity between the rich and the 99%. 
- When we spread unverified facts and cruel political slogans via social media
  without ever thinking about the consequences, we veer further from reasoned
  debate and deeper into divided vitriol. 
- When we allow politicians to pass laws that enable the rich to get richer and
  to escape retribution for causing millions to get much poorer, we ensure the
  downtrodden will begin to throw stones. 
- When we disproportionately portray Blacks as violent law breakers who use
  drugs, assault and maim, be it on the news or on The Wire, we allow Whites to
  feel superior and justified in their hatred and mistreatment. 
- When we falsely cast Hispanics as rapists and murders who stole jobs and
  would eventually steal our very country, we ignore the companies that need
  those workers or want to pay workers less. 
- When we snicker that of course boys will be boys, we give rise to a culture
  that believes women can be sexually abused by men and their abilities and
  intellect denigrated.
- When we let our school systems abandon their role in educating us in how a
  democracy works and what our rights and responsibilities are, we erode the
  citizen knowledge base our country needs in order to govern itself.

In my darkest moments I think it’s too late. We’ve already turned ourselves
into something that no longer can call itself a Democracy. And that we’ve all
done it to ourselves. I only hope I’m wrong.
