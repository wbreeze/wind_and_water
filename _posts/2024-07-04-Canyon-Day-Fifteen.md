Today we rowed and paddled from Indian Canyon Camp (Mile ~207) to 221 mile
camp, with a layover at Three Springs Canyon (Mile ~216). The group that
launched with us was costumed for this Fourth of July holiday. We passed their
camp, then saw them as they also stopped at Three Springs.

Peter had the recollection of Three Springs being terraced with [travertine
pools][pool]. Sometime since his last visit, a wash took-out all of the pools.
What remained was a trickle of water thick with shrubby, prickly plants.
It was beautiful still. We rested, lunched, and sought shade there before
heading down to the camp.

Once again, I was paddling the IK and there were few rapids. I made more
photos of cactus in camp.
