This was the day we paddled and rowed from Lava Canyon camp (Mile ~66) to Hance
camp (Mile ~77) through a part of the trip where the canyon opens up and
becomes almost pastoral, if you can use that word anywhere about the canyon.
There were a few rapids, including Nevills rapid, named after Norman Nevills,
one of the first to offer river trips for hire.  Nevills developed this wooden
cataract boat in the late thirties and early forties.

Right here, find a few photos of Chris paddling the inflatable kayak (IK) and
Faerthen paddling her pack raft.

After making camp above the Hance rapid, we scouted it a bit.  We got to see
the Canyon Explorations expedition with the Nevills historic boat restoration,
[Sandra running the Hance rapid][sandra] run the rapid.
