excerpt: Anyone messing around with aerobatics will eventually surprise
  themselves with a spin. Sometimes sooner, often later. The scary kind we call
  "aggravated". The kind that spring like a tiger from out of nowhere to pin you
  down with their hot breath in your face, ready to rip out your throat and tear
  open your rib cage.

Anyone messing around with aerobatics will eventually surprise themselves with
a spin. Sometimes sooner, often later. The scary kind we call "aggravated". The
kind that spring like a tiger from out of nowhere to pin you down with their
hot breath in your face, ready to rip out your throat and tear open your rib
cage.

With training, there is a reliable and well practiced recovery that overcomes
the panic. Without the training, outcomes are mixed but generally poor. The
spin training I received early on saved my life twice.  Watching videos on
YouTube doesn't cut it.
Part of the problem is that you'll think you know better.
Find someone who knows to take you out flying and share with you.

Here's an outline of an aerobatic syllabus that you can crib from. The bold
items people ought to have dual before going out to play on their own. Too few
do. If you're flying a competition aerobatic airplane, not a Beach Bonanza or
anything turbine, it will do all of these things without giving any trouble:

- Basic safety rules- positive exchange, bail out procedure
- Simulated bail out
- Simulated rip cord pull
- Minimums-- establishing a floor
- Dutch rolls
- Zero G
- Ballistic rolls
- 45 up, 45 down
* **Well developed upright left-rudder spin at least ten turns and recovery, note vertigo**
* **Well developed upright right-rudder spin, note the differences**
* **Adding power in the left rudder upright spin-- the dreaded flat spin**
* **Accelerated upright left rudder spin**
* **45 up line held to fall out**
* **45 up line to tumble**
- Inverted flight entered from ballistic half roll, level inverted, dish back to upright
- Inverted level flight with turns
- Inverted dutch rolls
- 45 up half roll to inverted, float inverted to 45 down, half roll to upright
* **Inverted right rudder fully developed spin**
* **Inverted left rudder fully developed spin**
* **Crossover spin**
* **Inverted left rudder accelerated spin**
* **Inverted right rudder flat spin**
- Loops and
* **botched loops**
- 45 up, half roll to inverted, vertical down
- Vertical to 45 inverted, half roll upright
- Hammerhead turn and
* **botched hammerhead to inverted spin**
- Competition turns
- Aileron rolls
