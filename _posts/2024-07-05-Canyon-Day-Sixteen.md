We started the day at our last camp, 221 mile camp. Our takeout appointment
was eleven in the morning. We could land and begin breaking-down the rafts
at ten. The Diamond takeout is at mile 225.5, about; so, we dawdled.
It was the first time on the trip that we didn't rush and rush to break down
camp and get on the river.

We dawdled again on an eddy with a sandy bank a mile above the takeout.
Faerthen dubbed it "the deadly sand bar" because first, Chris found a tiny
scorpion on his sleeve. Then, Mia was frightened by a big spider crawling on
her.  When we all stood up there was a warning rattle. Right behind where we
were sitting was a black-tailed rattle snake. The snake had laid low. When we
all got up it felt menaced by us, made itself known and fierce looking.  We
regarded it cautiously and curiously while it faced us down, driving us back
onto the river.

The takeout was fast and fast. The drive up twenty miles of  gravel road, in a
van, out of Diamond, was the most dangerous part of the trip. The driver kept
the speed up to minimize the duration and have the tires planing over the ruts
and ridges in the road. The van did not so much lurch as drift when we hit
them. We drifted around corners and forever uphill until we drove through a
housing development and out onto a highway.

By mid afternoon we were dumping our gear out of the back of the PRO truck
onto the parking lot at the hotel. We slept that night in beds, with air
conditioning, for the first time in over two weeks. We took long showers.

After dinner together at the same restaurant where we dined together on the
night before launch, we said some goodbyes and parted. End of canyon trip.
