We had a watery start to this day directly after launch from camp at mile ~77.
Some of us went for a morning swim in the Hance rapid. It was a bonding
experience as we closed ranks and came-out together on top. The river offered a
sobering reminder that it can serve up something more exciting than an amusing
roller coaster ride.

Below the rapid we got to see the first magnificent formations of metamorphic,
black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite at river level. We ran the
Grapevine (6, Mile ~82) and Zoroaster (4, Mile ~85) rapids before taking a
quick dip into the developed world at Phantom Ranch (Mile ~88). Ah, sweet
lemonade on ice!

Right after Phantom, at mile ~91 we ran the Horn, a mean seven rapid that one
member of our party confided to me they were truly afraid of. With good reason.
All of us threaded its narrow gateway between a pair of hungry holes,
thankfully without incident and with great relief.

We ran Granite Rapid, another seven at mile ~94, then camped at the head of
Hermit, in Hermit Camp (Mile ~95.5). I dubbed Hermit camp as "Lizard" camp
because there were lots of little entertaining lizards running around.
