On our second day in the Grand Canyon we rowed and paddled from Sheer
Wall camp (Mile ~14.5) to Shinumo Wash camp (Mile ~29.5).

Our group of eight in the photo left to right are Jeff, Faerthen, Douglas,
Kari (waving from behind us, in her raft), Mia, Peter, and Christie.
Chris made this photo and appears in most of the group photos on other
days.

Here we reached a layer of limestone mixed into the sedimentary
rock slopes and cliffs.
