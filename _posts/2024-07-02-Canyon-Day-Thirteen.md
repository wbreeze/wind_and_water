Day lucky thirteen was Lava day-- dramatic and fortunately without incident.
The rapids named "Lava" are the most infamous rapids on the trip. We had
already run Hance, Horn Creek, Hermit, Crystal and Upset-- all eights.
We had run Bedrock and Deubendorff-- both sevens. Those seven rapids are also
rated high on the Grand Canyon scale for challenge and danger, yet; Lava Falls
at mile 179.7 is the rapid everyone talked about for the whole trip.
We would say, "ah yes, that is a knarly one; but, wait until we hit Lava."

The great Vulcan's Anvil that rises out of the river a little after mile
178 gives warning to those who pass. Its Vulcan Rapid, better known as
Lava Falls awaits a mile and a half downstream.

We scouted the rapid from the hill above the right bank. Chris scouted
from the left bank. We watched him run the left side of the rapid in
the inflatable kayak. The left side was less steep yet still very challenging.
The left side was too shallow and narrow in places for our rafts.
In our rafts, we had to run right. We had to run by the mean holes through
the deeper, more turbulent part of the rapid.

In the end it was nothing. It demanded our respect and attention, yet;
given the scope of our anticipation and readiness, nothing of consequence
transpired. We ran Lava. We felt elated to be over it.

Downstream, the lava formations in the canyon draw figures
in the rock faces. Imagine the terrible face of Vulcan, an eagle spreading its
wings, an owl in flight.

We camped at Whitmore Wash (Mile ~188.5). It was an adrenaline clearing
afternoon in a camp with little shade. We gathered all of the dead shoes
together in a pile and made a photograph. The canyon heat, together with
scrambling over rocks when exploring, was more than the attachments for
our sandal straps could bear. On some of the shoes, the soles came unglued.
In all, eight pair of shoes died on our journey down the Grand Canyon
Colorado River.
