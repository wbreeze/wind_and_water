excerpt: Watching some sea birds on the western shore of the Sea of Cortéz
---

This afternoon in late November a fresh breeze stirs up moderate waves and
white horses on the Sea of Cortéz between Loreto and Isla Carmen.
Watching from the small marina in Loreto, four different
species of sea bird work the wind and the uplift of air off of the
sea wall.

One is the magnificent frigate bird. These have long wing spans with an
aggressive gull bend such that the points of the wings where they bend
from forward to rear ward sweep extend out in front of their heads.
They have forked tails (not seen in the photo) such that the locals
call them "tijeras", which means scissors.

Mostly the frigate birds like to soar and don't do much else. According to
the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigatebird)
they sometimes remain airborne for days and even sleep for brief
periods, at night, while soaring at high altitude.
They don't settle upon or dive in the water, but rather steal fish from
birds that do. Their wing form is so well suited to soaring that they
seldom need to flap their wings. They soar in groups, magnificent to watch.

Along with the frigate birds are the familiar gulls. The gulls are more
versatile. They fly by beating their wings, soar, land on the water, choose
prominent places on shore to stand and watch. Like the frigate birds, they
can be thieves, but mostly scavenge whatever floats up that is edible.

![tern flying]({% link /assets/images/2020/seabirds/tern.jpg %})

Together with the gulls are the terns. You might not notice at first their
difference; however, the terns have wings with a narrower chord that are
longer relative to the lengths of their bodies. Where the gulls' wings are
more forward, the terns' wings are about mid-way on their bodies.

The biggest difference between the gulls and the terns is that the terns
are active fishers. They soar, fly, and hover, suddenly
folding their wings and diving headlong at great speed into the water.
A half a second later they emerge with a fish, swallow it quickly, and
take to the air again.

Both the terns and the gulls operate in flocks, circling back into one
another to remain in a rough group. Unlike the gulls, the terns don't
appear to fly off by themselves so often to go solo, or stand on the
top of a rock or sit on the water.

![pelicans flying]({% link /assets/images/2020/seabirds/pelicans.jpg %})

The fourth species is the pelican. Like the terns, they are active fishers
who dive into the surface of the water to grab fish swimming below.
Their dives are sudden, rapid, and at an angle that the fish don't see
them coming.

The pelicans are larger than the terns, with bodies and heads like a duck
or goose and broad wings more like an eagle or falcon, with feathered tips.
Their most distinctive feature is their long bill, of course. The lower portion
of their bill has the distinctive pelican sack that the upper portion covers.

The pelicans will soar and fish in pairs or small groups. They also sometimes
fly in well organized flocks. As flocks, the pelicans behave more like geese
than like gulls or terns. They string themselves out in long lines, each
taking advantage of the vortices of air from the wings of the pelican
ahead of them. On this day, a group of a hundred or so was seen flying in
files, low over the water.

Flying low on the water into the strong wind, they took advantage of the
extra lift they get from the air compressed between their wings and bodies
and the surface, something we call "ground effect" in aviation. The resistance
of the sea surface to the wind slows the wind, so they had less wind to
work against. Third, they advantaged the already mentioned vortex wake of
their companions ahead. What marvelous aviators they are, the pelicans.

Soaring frigate birds, diving terns and pelicans, gulls kibitzing on the
scene and keeping an eye on things. Plenty of fish in the sea for all of
them. A great blue sky. The wind and the waves and the birds in their
perfect world.
