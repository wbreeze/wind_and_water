My COVID enforced vacation started when I abandoned La Paz in Baja California
Sur to head to Portugal, where I was turned-back from their recently closed
border and sent packing to the United States.  I landed in a beautiful place in
the northern Adirondack park owned by a dear friend, and vacant for the winter.

At first, it was cold and inhospitable outside. I worked my way through some
of the books on the bookshelf while learning to regulate the wood stove.
There were two books of note.

Jonathan Raban's _Passage to Juneau_, which in part explored the aboriginal
northwest coastal people's experience of and relationship with the natural
world. That exploration was richer, more nuanced, insightful, and far more
interesting than the respect-for-nature clichés we sometimes get fed about
native Americans.  As one example, they viewed the water the way we view a
landscape, rich in features with place names and markers.  We tend to view a
body of water as a naked expanse with something on the other side.

H.A. Rey's _The Stars_ is by far the best ever exploration of the night sky as
it appears to us when light pollution and clouds don't interfere.  I decided to
get serious, and learned a bunch of constellation and
star names, including how to find and identify them. We had a few clear
nights to practice when I, with some effort, overcame my fear over being
outdoors in the wild, in complete darkness, in the cold, and went out into
the clearing or down by the lake to look.

I found a few basic books about sailing and navigation rules on the bookshelf.
I read those as review to make sure I hadn't missed much. As always, there
were things that I had missed or that needed reinforcing.
Having navigated these primers, I bought Chapman
and have gotten through half of it. I also downloaded Bowditch and likewise
have made it through halfway.

I found a couple of mistakes in Bowditch--
editorial glitches --communicated them, and received responses from the editors
with corrections. That responsiveness impressed me.
Did the slowdown make us slow down so we can attend to important things?

There were two apps that I wanted on my phone as a future sailboat dweller.
One was an organizer that would help me search for that thing I know I have
but can't remember where it is. The app, "My Containers" by Robert Hartman, Jr.
turned out to be perfect.

The other app was one which tells time using ship's bells. I couldn't find
an existing one that worked. My computer was sitting idle. I learned something
of the Swift programming language from Apple and wrote the app. My friend
Andrés in Uruguay made me a super sweet icon for it. If only the app looked
that good!

When it got a little nicer outside, I started staying out for hours at a time,
usually in the afternoon. First I raked. There was a lot of lawn debris all
over the grounds. I raked-up bushels of it, moving it in a wheelbarrow to
the leaf pile composting in the woods below one of the buildings.

Having done that, I looked at beautiful stone walks around the property
that had generous encroachments of moss and sod working their way in from
the edges. Would there be any harm in edging those? I thought not, and did it.

Those outdoor projects took up a couple of weeks of afternoons. Having done
them, I thought "Well, now what?" When you think that, be careful.

![Paint Station](/assets/images/covid-vacation/paint-station.jpeg)

I got permission from my friend to work on repainting the trim on the
buildings. It hadn't been painted in over twenty years. The peeling paint
everywhere showed it. This turned-out to be a much bigger job than I'd
envisioned, and I'd envisioned that it would be a big job. Firstly I reduced
scope from all of the buildings to the main building. Secondly, I added hours.
It kept me busy through the six weeks in which the landscape altered from
winter to early summer.

There were perks, too.

- I lay in the sun when the weather was fine.
- I took the kayak out on the lake.
- The neighbor loaned me a sunfish to sail.
- I trained a chipmunk, my only companion, to sit on my hand and take
whole peanuts.
- I dreamed a lot, did a lot of sailboat browsing on the internet, bothered
a few sellers to tell me more about them.
- I talked with my friends and family quite a bit, maybe a little more.
- I continued to work on my Spanish, writing and posting some of the essays
I've written as exercises together with my Spanish teacher.
- Many evenings I streamed movies or serial episodes on the good internet.

Apple TV had a serial, "For All Mankind" which was in the setting of the
Apollo space program only, what if the Russians had gotten first to the
moon and the space race had continued? (Did the Russians actually try for the
moon? I'm not sure they picked up the gauntlet. To us, in the United States,
we were definitely racing to the moon. We made the "by the end of this decade"
bar set by President Kennedy.)

The serial, "The Morning Show" was great because of how it depicted
television journalism and sexual harassment. Reese Witherspoon was brilliant.
I loved her character, Bradley Jackson, who always tried to keep it real.
The TV executive character Cory Ellison
had a sharp wit and impish, take chances attitude that was fun to watch.
And of course there's Jennifer Aniston. I've always been in love with
Jennifer Aniston. Me and a thousand other guys and I'm no Brad Pitt;
but Jennifer, if you're listening, let's have coffee.

One movie I especially liked was from Apple TV. Called, "The Banker", it is
about some black men who became successful realtors by renting to black people
when others wouldn't.  Later they tried banks, lending to black people when
others wouldn't. That's when they got into trouble. White folks didn't like it
when black folks moved into the building. When their savings started being
loaned to black folks, they drew the line.

I watched with joy the marches and with dread the rioting that broke-out all
over the country in reaction to cell phone video capturing yet another police
killing of an innocent black man. A friend turned me on to a book by Ta-Nehisi
Coates, _Between the World and Me_.  Framed as story told to his son, it
relates his personal experience of being black, identified as a race by the
world of people who identify as white. He defines race as "the organization of
people beneath, and beyond, the umbrella of rights."

There's no other purpose to race. He writes early on, "race is the child of
racism, not the father." Members of polite society deny being racist;
however, if we think in terms of race, if we identify a race, we are already
racist. By definition. Better to admit it. The United States has a racist
society. Whether an individual is bigoted or not, that is another question,
and more likely a question of degree than of essence. We are, however, racist.

At the same time as people all over the country were demonstrating,
we got to see two Americans launch to the international
space station from the United States-- the first U.S. manned mission
in about a decade, since the
shutdown of the space shuttle program. It was like 1969 all over again.

So here I was, from the equinox marking the beginning of the sidereal year
up to the solstice that marks summer in the northern hemisphere.
I burned through half the firewood in the wood shed, which is a goodly amount.
I consumed a bottle of bourbon, one of tequila, and one of rum, which is
more than my usual annual intake.

![Sunset on Lower Lake](/assets/images/covid-vacation/lower-lake-sunset.jpeg)

I ate through $780 of groceries including three jars of peanut butter,
thirty pounds of flour, fourteen pounds of rolled oats, five and a half
pounds of raisins, twelve pounds of rice, eight pounds of legumes,
and ten pounds of peanuts.

Add three bags of whole peanuts for the chipmunk. This was less than she would
have liked; but, I tried to ration. I won't always be there for the chipmunk.

As with most of us, not once did I eat out. As with many of us, not once
did I order in. Believe it or not, ordering in was possible, even out here
in the woods by the lake.

At the beginning of the isolation period there was a big run on toilet paper.
Someone suggested to me that this was because people have no idea how much
toilet paper they use, and didn't want to err on the side of too little.
My data point is this. Three months equals one, one-thousand sheet, single-ply
roll.
