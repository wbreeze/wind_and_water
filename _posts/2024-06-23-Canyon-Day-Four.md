This was the day we rafted from Lower Saddle camp (Mile ~48) to Lava Canyon
camp (Mile ~66). We stopped to hike up to the granaries at Nankoweap (Mile
~53.5). There are some views of the river and canyon from high up on the
hillside. We lunched beside the stunning, aqua blue Little Colorado River (Mile
~62). In [photo 1083 looking down river](

you can make-out the [desert view watchtower][tower] above the canyon on the
south rim.

After making camp at Lava Canyon, some of us went for a little hike. We were
entertained by ravens visiting the next morning.
