"If you were marooned on a desert island, what two people would you want
with you?"

"The President of the United States and their spouse."

"What? Why?"

"Because I'd be damned sure of getting off of the island."

The thing about this joke is the irony that "important" people in high places
can make things happen, things that the rest of us cannot. That's real power.
