In 2011 I started a project for pilot flight time logging and called it,
"myFltTime.com". The idea was to do something I knew, and try to build a
software as a service (SAAS) product that would bootstrap into a sustainable
business.

Like every entrepreneur starting a business, I knew that I would succeed.
I was optimistic. This is normal and necessary.

It didn't cost me a lot in terms of dollars to set it up and get it running.
It did cost me a lot of time. In terms of sunken costs and not cutting-loose,
the time invested was the greatest impediment. The more time I put into it,
the less I was willing to hear that it wasn't working and best abandoned.

One of the things that I didn't pay attention to was that it is a
crowded market. There were and are a lot of other solutions for this.
I convinced myself that mine would be the best, and that I had a very clean
migration path that made bootstrapping from paper logs or importing from
another solution pretty friction free. I invested time in that.
I did a pretty good job of it.

More saliently, working as a pilot, I met a lot of pilots. Talking to
them about logging their flight time, I kept hearing that they don't.
Most professional working pilots rely on the logging they're already
doing with their employer.
Those that kept their own logs-- private pilots and the rare professional
--were very attached to the things they were using. Pilots aren't
big risk takers. The reliable known is preferable to them. Change isn't
welcome, and I didn't have good compelling reasons to get them to change.
Fewer than fifty pilots even tried it.

In the past few years I didn't do a lot with it. Very little. But kept it
online, paying the hosting fees, because I couldn't bring myself to throw
away all of the work I'd invested in it.
Now I'm at the place where I wouldn't know what to do if by some fluke
of economics a dozen or so pilots start using it. Or worse, thousands.
Time having passed, the lost time and effort that I had invested in it
is less of a memory. Shutting it down, at last, feels like a positive.
I save the hosting fees. Money kept in pocket. A win.
