A couple of months ago, I listened to a pod-cast from Hi Phi Nation about a
disagreement between the documentary film maker Errol Morris and philosopher
Thomas Kuhn. The podcast is called, "The Ashes of Truth"
[Season 1, Episode 9, 18 April,
2017](https://hiphination.org/complete-season-one-episodes/episode-9-the-ashes-of-truth-april-18-2017/).

According to the pod-cast, Thomas Kuhn, in his popular book of 1962, _The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ described and gave name to the phenomenon
we call "paradigm shift." He used it for scientific breakthroughs; but, we've
generalized the meaning.  In the paradigm shift, a system of belief is shaken
by some new observation, a new fact that is undeniable but impossible to
integrate into the system. The system of belief has to change.

One person in the pod-cast, Lydia Patton of Virginia Tech, describes it like
this: You're in the nineteenth century experimenting with electricity.
You think of electricity as a fluid moving through pipes, like liquid
through wire. Needing a little DC current, you cast about the lab for one of
the wet cell jars of sulfuric acid with plates of lead to power your experiment.
You don't find one, but someone points-out a stack of alternating zinc and
copper, dry metal plates and says you can get current out of that.

Now you have a problem. There's no liquid in a stack of alternating zinc and
copper, dry metal plates, yet it produces electricity. It's a "dry cell".
In order to use the dry cell, you have to accept that the
dry cell producing electricity is incommensurable with your understanding
of electricity as a fluid. Your mental model of the universe has to
shift. You have to abandon or at least fundamentally adjust your
whole concept of electricity.

Regarding truth then, with the paradigm shift, Kuhn created a problem.
The beliefs before and after the paradigm shift were both true.
At the time of belief, they represented truth. This leads to a
degenerative concept of truth, that it is forever provisional, present
only until it is presented with something incommensurable to challenge it,
and a paradigm shift. And the new truths are only true within the new paradigm.
There's no overall paradigm from which to evaluate the truth of all
possible paradigms. There's no absolute truth.

Thus we get to skepticism, Errol Morris, and documentary film making.
When we watch or listen to a documentary, more than when we watch or
listen to the news, we have an expectation of being presented with
facts and truths. But truth is filtered through perception, our perception
and that of the film maker. Perception is influenced by our knowledge,
values, education, upbringing, in fact our belief system or working
paradigm about how the world functions.

From this you can say that a film about the murder of a police officer, "The
Thin Blue Line" isn't factual or documentary at all, but just another story.
The people in the film are relating what they saw or heard filtered through
their perceptions and beliefs. The film-maker is deciding what to record based
upon their belief. The editing, sequencing, and presentation of the film
recordings that make-up the movie are all intentional, filtered through what
the makers of the film have come to believe and want to present through the
film. If you don't like where it goes, you use that to discredit it.

There's the phenomenon that we only see and seek out that which reinforces
our beliefs, discounting, avoiding, denying, even attacking
anything uncomfortable that might be
incommensurate with our beliefs. (There's the phenomenon too that social
media machine learning algorithms are very good at learning and reinforcing
that behavior in their drive to survive, reproduce, and grow.)

How is it that a person can believe that the moon landing of 1969 was
faked in a studio? Lots of people believe this. How? Never mind
that thousands of people were involved with the moon program, hundreds
would have to be involved in a studio production of such magnitude, and
that the President of the United States would have to have been part of the act.
Never mind that all of those people would have to consistently
maintain the fiction.
Said President was later found to have attempted cover-up of a
different scheme of much smaller scale and equal import.

It must be that, to the faked moon landing believers, the picture of a
film studio is familiar and possible. They can imagine it. Imagining three
people two hundred fifty thousand miles away in two metal cans powered
by rockets, for real, talking to other people on earth using electromagnetic
waves, sending pictures from the moon. That's just too much.
Impossible.

To believe the second, that two people were on the moon and a third
orbiting the moon above them, you have to be comfortable with a world of
technology of which you have no understanding,
that there's a world of engineering
capability around you, that you walk in day to day, that you'll possibly
never grasp, with any amount of effort, in your lifetime. You have to
accept that your life and knowledge and place in the world is limited,
perhaps smaller that you've ever imagined before.
And then integrate that into a sense of self that you can live with.

When called to believe in something we don't understand, how do we
distinguish between the flying spaghetti monster and landing on the moon?
One is something we have to take on faith, for whatever purpose, to
feel as if we have understanding. The other something we can
learn about and understand, rather than deny as something that can only
be accepted on faith. Thus the importance of education in creating a
world where self-serving reductionist arguments about relative
truth and the truth of your lies don't get you to a position of high
political office. Did I make too big a leap there?

We hate not knowing. Our nature is that we are
extremely uncomfortable with lack of knowledge. We'll often go to great lengths
to present any amount of explanation of something we know nothing about simply
to avoid a simple admission that we just don't know. This extends so far as to
cause us to believe in our explanations and, beyond admitting it, not even to
be aware that we just don't know. Instead, we accept the stories constructed
by or for us, anything
plausible, rather than remain in the uncomfortable vacuum, the inhospitable,
virtiginous free-fall acceptance of nothing, no knowledge. No idea.

Or at the very least, if we're going to have no idea about it, it is
going to be something of absolutely no importance. It's okay or even fashionable
to be ignorant about it, whatever the subject, because it just doesn't matter.
Or rather more than doesn't matter, it mustn't matter.
It critically mustn't matter, because otherwise there's the abyss.

beasts]({% link /assets/images/DanteRescuedByVirgil.jpg %})

As such, in social settings, it is essential
to either have a story or to be invisible and not matter.
If you matter and don't have a story, people will invent stories.
In a way, having stories about you is how you're visible.
So you tell your story and layer privacy. You have a story about yourself
that is public, more stories for friends, more stories for intimates.
In the outer sphere, you create a persona
that people will accept and if you're ambitious, you manipulate it.
It's safer to tell a story than to have others make one up for you,
although they'll do that too.

We've entered into a world in which people who manipulate truth and
perception have unprecedented power to do so. From a position of notoriety
and attention, with an intuitive or well educated, practiced
understanding of the nature of seduction and belief, you can command
support to put you in a place of real power over real things.
(It's probably been that way for a long time. Only now we have Twitter.)

In order to be immune to fictions, in order to be real,
we can't simply be attentive to facts, actions, what is directly observed.
We have to accept that without them, we just don't know. Uncomfortable as that
is, a story feels so much better, it's very likely the case. Without facts,
we have
to live in the space of no idea, nothing, no assumptions. When
it comes to measuring the motivations of a human being we're especially in
the dark, as Robbie Burns penned: "What's done we partly may compute,//
But know not what's resisted."

"The Thin Blue Line" is a wonderful documentary film about how we can become
enamored with a story that's congruent with our beliefs, blinded
to facts. Another, longer one, is ["The Hurricane
Tapes"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttt6), a podcast about
the prosecution of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter for a triple murder.

There's more to both stories, such as when accepting a fact or correcting
a wrong would mean betrayal of your clan. In the Hurricane story, not giving
anything away, two clans are at war, and the truth serves neither.

Getting back to the nature of truth and reality, and how it feels when
our beliefs are challenged, Errol Morris notes in the pod-cast
that, "Everything is a reenactment. Consciousness is a reenactment
of the world outside of our skulls,
and the task is how to get back to the world from that reenactment
inside of our skulls."

The pod-cast arrives at a way out of the problem of truth
being provisional to a paradigm or system of beliefs. The way out is, "come on,
keep it real." You don't have to load-up a documentary film with a regressive,
recursive journey through all of the filters of perception and interpretation
until it becomes a work of art, fiction, a story told by the people who made
it. No. It's a documentary film, made broadly or narrowly within the
conventions of documentary film. It isn't a Star Wars movie. It isn't a Jason
Bourne, James Bond, or Indiana Jones thriller. It isn't "The Silence of the
Lambs". It's a telling of something that really happened, however much you
don't like it.

There is truth. It's complicated. However, that you
ordered the prosecutor to ignore your friend's involvement in a crime
is a fact. You did
or you didn't. You didn't say it but not mean it, expecting the prosecutor to
ignore you. You didn't wink as if to say, "Yes, I'm saying that for my friend,
but go ahead anyway." The prosecutor didn't misinterpret you. Any of that is
revisionary denial to give your supporters a way to keep supporting you, and
another lie in the stack you've built your house on.

A friend, the same friend who shared the pod-cast with me, shared an essay by
Timothy Kreider, [Life Is What Happens
In-Between](https://humanparts.medium.com/life-is-what-happens-in-between-b8112281ced0).
It talks about the feeling we have when our lives are disrupted by travel or
unexpected major life changes. It describes
the uncomfortable feeling of disconnection, having been unplugged from
our routines where suddenly we question who we are.

The essay talks about being on a book tour and feeling a sense of
dislocation and "being in the world" described in Kim
Stanley Robinson’s novel, _2312_, and how these periods of dislocation
can get us out of our own heads, into
a virtiginous sense of possibility, direct experience, and perspective.

When someone close to us dies. When a relationship breaks up. When a
friend betrays us. When we get lost in a very strange place.
These events sometimes take us outside
of ourselves into that uncomfortable void of not knowing, questioning. Sometimes
everything we thought we understood comes into question. What do they really
think of me at my job? What are people saying to one another about me? Who can
I trust? With what? Is my work any good? Is it worthwhile? Is God good?

Or what am I doing with this short life I'm given? Is it what I want, what I
feel I was born for? Am I somehow stuck, needing to break-out? Do I have the
courage to do that? Do I dare?

The best art somehow makes us feel that discomfort. Just enough. Not too much.

![Moon orbit]({% link /assets/images/Moon_apsidal_precession.png %})

Eventually we settle down and we're still the same person. The unsettling
shift to a new way of thinking becomes just a fact, like, that the
[plane of orbit of the moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon)
is about five degrees away from the ecliptic and twenty-eight and a half degrees
away from the equator. Understanding why the moon wanders around so much
in the sky, rising and setting in different places,
is one more aspect of the world
integrated into the whole of what is us. It becomes an expansion of the
experience.  Life goes on. We're wiser. Until the next time.

For me, it's that we swim in an ocean of lies, and I'm one of the fish.
When I think I'm being honest, I'm lying to myself. When I reach for
authenticity, I miss out on a true thing.
