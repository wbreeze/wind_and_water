We ran from Deer Creek (Mile ~137) to Matkat Hotel (Mile ~149)
through a deep, narrow canyon. We stopped at Matkatamiba Canyon briefly, thanks
to clam cleats well placed by Chris to anchor our boats. The Canyon Expeditions
trip was there and left ahead of us to camp further down the canyon.

A [Western Diamondback Rattlesnake][rattle] suffered our presence in Matkat
camp.  Mia found it keeping cool in the shade of the river bank near where we
had landed our rafts. Thanks to Faerthen for the identification. She said,
"That’s actually one of the more dangerous rattlers, not the calm species from
further north." According to the Wikipedia article, "It is likely responsible
for the majority of snakebite fatalities in northern Mexico and the greatest
number of snakebites in the U.S."

It allowed some of us close enough to make photos and videos.
Up in camp, we sought shade just as did the rattler. The sun felt infernal
at times. The temperature was one-hundred and three (ºF). The sand heated
by the sun was too hot to walk on barefoot. It burned the feet. It melted the
glue in some of our shoes. More on that, later.

Would you believe that, with all of this adversity that we love to talk about,
we were content and happy? Lazy and relaxed? It was just so. Chris, always
the explorer, found a trail up, over the bluff, to the Matkatamiba Canyon.
We had not remained in the canyon for long when we had anchored our boats
in the rock. A thunderstorm threatened to the south. We were afraid of a
flash flood washing us out of the canyon. See? There you go. I'm writing again
to make drama. The visuals, the sounds, and the closeness of the river
induced within some of us a serene calm. It was lovely. We marvelled in it.
