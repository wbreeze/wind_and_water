It's something to think about. Try to keep it real.

As for me (although no one has been so unkind as to say this), there's
passion in tilting at windmills.

Yet do. Try to keep it real.

#### Tilting at windmills

This characterization given to [Cervantes' don Quixote][quixote] is [defined in
Wikipedia][tilting] as "courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or
misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications" and "inopportune,
unfounded, and vain effort against adversaries real or imagined".

### Spanish language posts

The posts in Spanish are thanks to the help of my Spanish teacher, Nuria
Rodriguez. I write them as exercises, then we correct the grammar together. If
you don't read Spanish, why not? You can get in touch with Nuria at

### The Fascination of Whatâ€™s Difficult
- By William Butler Yeats

```
The fascination of what's difficult
Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
Spontaneous joy and natural content
Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt
That must, as if it had not holy blood
Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays
That have to be set up in fifty ways,
On the day's war with every knave and dolt,
Theatre business, management of men.
I swear before the dawn comes round again
I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.
```
