On this day we rowed and paddled from Bass (Mile ~109) to Below Fossil (Mile
~126) with a stop at beautiful Elves Chasm. We passed the camera around
and palled around climbing up into the cave and jumping down into the
pool.

With the half moon waning we are halfway in our trip. The river no longer
reflects blue sky nor makes crystalline sparkles reflecting the sun. With the
morning light it revealed another of its many aspects-- watery chocolate milk.
