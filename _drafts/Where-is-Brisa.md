So where is Brisa? Where has she been? To London? To visit the queen?

The Garmin hooked-up to inReach updates current location via satellite. When
the navigator thinks to do it, it will record tracks of voyages. You can see
them on [the Garmin share Brisa map][map] whenever you happen to take a poke at
it.

The page has a message button that enables you to send Brisa a tweet-sized
message from the browser.
