So where is Brisa? Where has she been? To London? To visit the queen?

![Brisa sailing track]({% link /assets/images/2021/BrisaTrack.png %})

There is a list of people who receive an update whenever Brisa weighs or drops
anchor. (To weigh anchor is to set sail.) Anchor's aweigh, my boys!

After a time, more and more people wanted to be on the list. Brisa only put
people known personally on the list. Being on the list had some currency,
and there came to be a market for phone numbers or email addresses that were
on the list. Only no-one would sell.

Someone, a stranger, once approached and asked to be added to the list.
They offered money.
The answer was, with a chuckle, no. The chuckle was the irony that anyone
would want to be on it. Get a message when Brisa starts and stops sailing.
That isn't much of a story unless you're personally connected.

Along came someone smart who spread the word that you can see what Brisa is
up to on [the Garmin share Brisa map][map] whenever you happen to take a look
at it.

Brisa has a Garmin GPS and communicator on board,
hooked-up to an inReach service,
that sends brief messages and location updates via satellite.
When the navigator thinks to do it, it sends live tracks of voyages in real
time as they occur.

The [where is Brisa map page][map]
has a message button that enables you to send Brisa a tweet-sized
message from your browser.
