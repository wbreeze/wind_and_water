I went looking for this photograph of me in my early forties, about twenty
years ago. Here it is.

You'll find a blog that I write in Spanish at [https://brisa.uy/][brisa].
A (currently) recent post, [Renovaci√≥n del Casco Muerto][lijando], has a pretty
long (one and three quarter minute) video showing me as I am now.

And this photograph here in Panama.

It's amazing how similar. Through all of the changes, these two resemble
each other. Now I'm tempted to make a value judgement about that. Instead,
think of it as one of the aspects that has surfaced from my full self, from
time to time.  Perhaps I'm revisiting this cycle. A sort of trying to relish
living cycle.

I still think that few people know what to make of me, that I'm a bit of
a freak. That hasn't changed.
