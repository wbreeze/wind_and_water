Back in the nineties, God and the Devil crossed paths.
God said, "Hey Devil, how do you like this new internet thing?
See how my children are creating this free expression,
information at their fingertips,
unhindered sharing of ideas, worldwide network
for peace, love and understanding?
My children will be back to the garden in no time.

The Devil said, "Sure God man, but I've got Zuckerberg, and no-one reads
the terms and conditions."

God took a look at Zuck, his circle and the Palo Alto crowd in general, and thought to
his mighty self, "Shit. Now, there it is! The snake in my garden."
