excerpt: On the main street, 18 July, that runs east to west from the old city
  to the cityâ€™s largest park, tens of thousands came out to walk silently (or at
  least with a murmuring whisper) in memory of the disappeared.

On the night of Friday, 20 May I participated in a march held annually in
the city of Montevideo, Uruguay since 1996. Similar marches were held in cities
and towns in every part of the country.

On the main street, 18 July, that runs east to west from the old city to the
city's largest park, tens of thousands came out to walk silently (or at least
with a murmuring whisper) in memory of the disappeared.

The poster reproduced here is an example of the 197 different posters carried
by some of the participants in the march-- one for each of the Uruguayan
nationals disappeared by the United States backed civil and military
dictatorship that gripped the country from 1973 to 1985.

Lila Epelbaum Slotopolsky was detained, taken prisoner by her government in
Maldonado, Uruguay on the fourth of November, 1976.  Her family and friends
never saw nor heard from her again.  They only know that she was secretly
murdered by the state and her body secretly disposed of. She is one of 197
desaparecidos (disappeared) during that brutal period of supression.

The U.S. State Department under leadership of Henry Kissinger and the
Central Intelligence Agency under leadership of George H.W. Bush, then Admiral
Stansfield Turner, then William J. Casey implemented [Operation Condor][con]
under the administrations of President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford.

In Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay people feared by those governments and
by the United States for their dissident viewpoints and outspoken opposition,
labeled "subversives", were detained without trial and often killed. One method
of disappearing "subversives" was to fly them out over the ocean and dump them
out of the plane.  This took care of both the murder of the individual and
disposal of their body. Very efficient.

The people marching in Montevideo Friday night want to keep their government
accountable, fourty-five years later, for the crimes of the state during that
period-- primarily the murder of 197 people. This is 197 too many and not a big
number. So you see that Uruguayans have a low threshold of tolerance for state
sponsored murder. I would say, and infringement of liberties in general.  More,
they insist that their government be accountable to them.
