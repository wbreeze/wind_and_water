Here I rave about Terms of Service again. Why?
I gave an hour and a half and then another hour or two of my
precious life to reviewing the Bluesky ToS. Something is wrong with me.
I'm a raving lunatic.

There was reported a migration among people on the blue side of the U.S.
political spectrum away from X to another social platform called Bluesky. The
report attributed this mainly to the association of X owner Elon Musk with
President and President Elect Donald Trump. A friend asked me about Bluesky.
"Is it safe?," he asked? He doesn't use X, either.

TL/DR. Bluesky is to Twitter (or X) as Telegram is to Wpp. Same compromises,
different heads. It is not as [Signal][s] is to Telegram, Wpp, etcetera. Not
even close. It is equally evil as most. There is nothing better about it. It is
possibly worse because of the open AT protocol. It is yet another exposure.

# Terms of Service

conference at Camp Navarro, Mendocino County, California. That is a beautiful
redwood tree behind her. She's standing at a podium that says, "Boy Scouts of
America".

There was an [article on BBC][bbc] about how Jay Graber, the CEO of Bluesky,
did not know the minimum age for using the platform.  This information is in
the first paragraphs of the Terms of Service (ToS).  That she did not know
the answer indicates that, not only do you not read the ToS. The CEO of the
company doesn't read them, either.

I'm always interested in the asymmetries within ToS.  Generally, the provider
takes a lot and gives little.

- Account termination

2E: if you delete your account, they will delete what they can of the content
you have posted, best effort, no promises

4B: if they terminate your account, they will keep the user content that you
have posted


## Indemnity

12: In the case of a claim against Bluesky that Bluesky decides you are
responsible for, you pay and they play. They have total control. You pay all of
the costs. This is common to many ToS these days.  You might consider it a
non-starter if, not being a home owner, you have no kind of umbrella insurance
policy that would maybe protect you.  You are basically granting them your life
savings.

If you think, "I don't do anything wrong." Remember that they decide that. Not
you.  If you think, "That never happens." Ask, why is it there?  Perhaps in the
United States we are simply accustomed to this. A medical condition will break
many people with the bills.

13: on the other hand, they have no liability to you whatsoever; or, in any
case, not more than $100.


## Arbitration

14: It's little you against big them. You can't join with others to form a
class. You won't go to court. The arbitration committee will decide. Who are
they? Are they like the [Motion Picture Association][mpa]? I rate this an R.

[mpa]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association

I get it. Class action suits are expensive. Congress made this happen at the
behest of corporations. Power to the people? No. You are consumer cows. Say,
"mooooo." Give milk.


# Privacy policy

[Bluesky Privacy Policy][dd]

[dd]: https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy

This is a misleading term applied universally. These are **disclosures** of
information gathering and sharing. What they say is that your interaction
is **not** private. A more accurate title would be, "Data Sharing Disclosure."
Would **that** get your attention? Probably not.

Direct messages are unencrypted and accessible to moderators. That is anyone
who can phish a moderator for their credentials. Also anyone who can coerce
Bluesky into revealing them, such as U.S. law enforcement, or whomever.
It's just like messages at GMail. (Oh so sexy; and free!) You don't know who
reads them.

What you post is (obviously) available to anyone.  In additon, they track your
use of the site-- what you click, what you look at and how long, whom you
follow, how often you visit what feeds, etc.

They use this data for marketing and share it with business partners.
You don't know whom, when, how often nor for how much.

They retain the data as long as they want to.

# Copyright policy

[Bluesky Copyright Policy][copy]

[copy]: https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright

If you think someone has posted your copyrighted material you can contact them
and they will do something about it, or not, as they decide.

# Community guidelines

[Bluesky Community Guidelines][cg]

[cg]: https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines

- Don't do illegal stuff.

- Don't harass or threaten others.

- Email support if you want to turn someone in.

- They have this thing (an AT thing) called labels. It is basically hash tags.
Don't label inappropriately.


# Authenticated Transfer Protocol

Ah cool! They use this open source thing, [AT Protocol][atp].
That makes things authentic. No more fake news. Is that true?  What is it,
really?

[atp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol

AT Protocol is cross-app data sharing as an open standard versus, for example,
Meta corp's cross-app data sharing as proprietary to their app's. It provides a
common identity across app's that is useful for data aggregation.

That is to say, data that Bluesky gathers about your behavior on the
app is accessible by an open source protocol to third-party developers in order
to combine it with the data that other app's using the AT Protocol have
gathered about your behavior on those. Isn't that great!

It is distributed, rather than centralized.  Distributed simply means that
multiple data stores can share without need for a centralized store.  The
criticism in the Wikipedia article regarding Bluesky is that they keep a
centralized store anyway.

This link in the first paragraph of the Privacy Policy, for [Bluesky AT
Protocol Network Services Privacy Notice][bat] is broken as of this writing. It
returns 404.
