On day ten, our rest day, we visited "The Patio" of Deer Creek and Deer Creek
Falls.  To get there, we ferried with the kayak and a river raft out of the
eddy at camp, river left, across the top of the riffle below the creek entrance
to land at the creek on river right.

Next to the river, the creek falls in a narrow cascade of over one hundred
feet. At the bottom, the air carried down by the friction of the water
blows out from the wall, loaded with spray and mist.

A trail leads to the gorge above the falls and then inside of it. The water
has eroded a smooth, serpentine passage in the rock. The trail narrows to
a shelf. In one place it is necessary to grip a ledge and side-step along
the trail above a precipitous fall into the gorge and stream below.

The brave are rewarded with an eden of little cascades, green trees and
plants, and a great patio of shaded rock. A few of us brought snacks and
remained in this eden for hours simply absorbing the spirit of the place.

Further up the trail from the patio, Faerthen found and documented an agave
plant. She reported that the plant, Grand Canyon Agave (Agave phillipsiana) is
critically endangered and rare to find.  Archeologists speculate that the
Native Americans cultivated them for food, since they are usually found near
ancient habitation sites.  Faerthen's photo-documented observation was the
first for this plant to be [shared on the identification guide,
iNaturalist][inat].
