Today we rowed and paddled from Whitmore Wash (Mile ~188.5) to Indian Canyon
Camp (Mile ~207). There were few rapids on this stretch. One, I think.
I paddled the IK most of the way, thus; there are no photos on the river.

Indian Canyon camp had a thriving colony of Prickly Pear. We arrived fairly
early in the afternoon. I diverted myself sunning, napping, and then
photographing the cactus growing around camp. It was a sweet place, though the
sun was intense. There must have been some magic because Christie turned into a
mer-turtle.

Chris built a shelter over a ledge against a wall. It made a kind of
sheltered patio overlooking the river. The camp chairs migrated there for
a while.
