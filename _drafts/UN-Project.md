Some of you have brought the objection that this project is not a fit for
the United Nations. Allow me to tell you why it is, not to change your mind,
to provide a clearer lens in which to see, to quiet the air for you to hear.

The proposal is to work on a multinational basis to have nations unite in
enacting policies that prohibit all use of advertising.
What could be the benefit to doing that?
Peace, dignity, and equality in a healthy planet.

What is advertising? We know it when we see it. It is communication or
monipulation of communication in order to pursuade thinking, or; to incite or
alter behavior of the recipient.

Advertising is not the same as pursuation. Pursuasive speech is open about
the belief they would like you to adhere to. You agree to hear it, in order
to understand the belief if not to adopt it.
You are here voluntarily, to listen for information that helps you make
a better decision.

It is interesting how we begin to look for loopholes.
No, you cannot send invitations to persuasive sessions. That would be
advertising.
No, we are not going to allow blanket agreements. In fact, they would
be prohibited. You cannot agree to hear any kind of advertising.
