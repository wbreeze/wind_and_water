This was the day we rafted from Shinumo Wash camp (Mile ~24) to Lower Saddle
camp (Mile ~48) and visited Redwall Cavern. Shinumo Wash was the camp with a
thriving colony of Datura. In the photo, a white moth visiting the beautiful
white Datura flower. The Datura opens its flowers at night.

Experimenting with consuming the seeds or some other part of the plant is one
of the things that kills people visiting the canyon. The plant is deadly
poisonous, usually.  Carlos Castaneda in his first book, _A Yaqui Way of
Knowledge_ describes preparing it under supervision of a Yaqui Shaman for a
serious halucinogenic journey. He was near death for days.

On this day we had our first of many sightings of the Nevills Expedition
restored mid-century whitewater boat, Sandra. We passed and were passed
by this group many times. When camping above the Hance rapid we watched
them make a late afternoon run. When scouting the Crystal rapid they
were scouting ahead of us. We watched their run. We met them at the
rapid called Boulder (not Boulder, something) as we ran it on their heels.
They were at the -something- Canyon pull-out when we arrived there,
and left just ahead of us.

Here is a picture of the groover set up. One thing about camps in the
canyon: there's always a great view from the seat.
