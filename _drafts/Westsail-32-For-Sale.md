excerpt: Westsail 32 Brisa is up for sale.

Back in December, 2000 I wrote about my new
[Wandering home](
  {{ '/2020/12/wandering-home.html' | relative_url }}
), a Westsail 32 sailboat.

Three and a half years and nine thousand nautical miles later, Brisa is for
sale. The [Westsail 32 for sale announcement][w32] is at [Brisa.uy][uy], where
I have written in Spanish about my adventures sailing Brisa.  Although most of
the site is written in Spanish, the announcement is in English. Most potential
buyers will read in English.  I've placed it on [Brisa.uy][uy] because the
photographs reproduce there with a larger size.

I sailed Brisa for a fabulous year in the Gulf of California. It was the
best sailing there, a time of discovery and adventure in some of the best
parts of the world for snorkling, hiking, sailing, enjoying community, and
warming to sunshine, Mexican culture, and best of all, the Mexican food.

In my head was the idea to sail to Uruguay. That brought me to Panama and
through the Panama Canal. The marina at the Caribbean entrance to the canal,
Shelter Bay, was super accomodating. Brisa recieved a new paint job, new
main sail, new bronze through-hulls, and other improvements there.

For sailing, Panama is not the Gulf of California. Nevertheless, Bocas del
Toro in the rainy season and Guna Yala (aka San Blas) in the dry season
are super nice to sail in.

This year we sailed from Shelter Bay to Guna Yala, Cartagena, Grand Cayman,
Key West, and the ICW up to New York City and the Hudson Valley. That's a
lot of sailing and I'm about done. I'll have a break with a trip down the
Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. Returning, I'll sail the Long Island
Sound and Boston before returning south. That is if Brisa does not sell first.

The best part of sailing, for me, was having dolphins visit to play in
the bow wake. The dolphins were frequent visitors, always playful, always
feeling friendly and happy.

There are many things I'll miss. Otherwise, new adventures await.
