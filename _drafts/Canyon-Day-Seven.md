On this day we did our group photo after breakfast, while making our lunch.
Beginning at Hermit Camp (Mile ~95.5) we ran the Hermit Rapid, a seven, with
barely a thought it seems, while Crystal ran ahead in our thoughts, downstream
at mile ninety-nine. Crystal is one of the rougher rapids in the Canyon, rated
seven to ten, depending on flow.

Scouting Crystal at mile ~99 we met again with the Canyon Explorations and
their restored Nevills Cataract boat, Sandra. Check out a [photo series of "the
curl" in Crystal Rapid][curl]. This is one of the "holes" that everyone ran
right of and avoided. There is nothing in the photos for scale. Take my word
for it. It was big. That curling wave would readily swallow a raft.

We had the advantage and privilege of watching the Canyon Expeditions group
make their runs from a front row rock on shore.  See [photos of Canyon
Expeditons running Crystal Rapid][crystal]

Below Crystal, right away at mile ~100 are Tuna, a five to seven and Lower
Tuna, a four. At mile ~102 we hit Saphire, another six. From there to
Bass camp (Mile ~109) we ran Turquoise (2-4, Mile ~102.5), 104 Mile (5),
Ruby (4-5, Mile ~105.3), Serpentine (6, Mile ~106.6), and Bass (3, Mile ~108.5).
Day seven, to say the least, was a big whitewater day.
