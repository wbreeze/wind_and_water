On Brisa, we use the Garmin inReach service together with a Garmin GPSMap 86i
and the Garmin Explore app on an iPad for sharing location and short
text messages with friends and family on terra firma, via satellite.
There isn't, generally, a lot of internet available at sea.
We've used it four months over four-hundred or so miles of cruising within
the Gulf of California from the southern Baja to the upper Baja peninsula.
Here's a description about how it's working out.

In order to effectively use the service you will need:
- The Garmin inReach service subscription
- A Garmin GPSMap 86i or similar Garmin navigation device with inReach 
  satellite capability
- A smart phone or tablet
- A Garmin account
